Description: Correct, reproducible, and fast builds for everyone.

Modifications:
Only the needed subset of bazel tools directory has been imported.
Added necessary license declarations to BUILD files.
Built tools/jdk/*_deploy.jar

Remove tools/jdk/ijar binary and use a filegroup instead.

The extra_actions_base and test_status protos have their generated Go source code checked-in.

Two helper scripts (get_devdir.sh and get_sdkroot.sh) were created by
modifying src/tools/xcode/xcrunwrapper/xcrunwrapper.sh @
180d1b56b8aea8fab974cfa57e9182598990710c.
